# PLTTools for Spark

A spark package for processing
RMS ELT (Event Loss Table) and PLT (Period Loss Table)
data.

This is largely based on the work found in the 
[plttools](https://github.com/RMS-Consulting/plttools)
repo (MIT License).  
Since we use spark for data processing, the 
code structure is somewhat different than what 
is found in the `plttools` repo.
